Built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) inspired by [Gatsby's default starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default).

2.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data.
